# example of file for storing private and user specific environment variables, like keys or system paths
# rename it to ".env" (excluded from version control by default)
# .env is loaded by train.py automatically
# hydra allows you to reference variables in .yaml configs with special syntax: ${oc.env:MY_VAR}

MY_VAR="/home/user/my/system/path"


#The .env file is typically used to store private and user-specific environment variables, such as keys or system paths. It is excluded from version control by default to prevent sensitive information from being exposed. In this example, the .env file contains a variable named MY_VAR with the value "/home/user/my/system/path".

#Here's the content of the .env file:

#makefile
#Copy code
#MY_VAR="/home/user/my/system/path"
#In the train.py script, Hydra will automatically load the environment variables from the .env file, making them available for use in the configuration YAML files. You can reference these variables in the YAML files using the special syntax ${oc.env:MY_VAR}.

#For example, if you have a YAML configuration file with a key data_dir, you can set its value to the environment variable MY_VAR as follows:

#yaml
#Copy code
#data_dir: ${oc.env:MY_VAR}
#This way, the value of data_dir in the YAML file will be replaced with the value of the environment variable MY_VAR, allowing you to configure the paths or other settings based on the user's environment.
