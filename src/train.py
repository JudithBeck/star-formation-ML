pyrootutils.setup_root(__file__, indicator=".project-root", pythonpath=True)
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ #
# the setup_root above is equivalent to:
# - adding project root dir to PYTHONPATH
#       (so you don't need to force user to install project as a package)
#       (necessary before importing any local modules e.g. `from src import utils`)
# - setting up PROJECT_ROOT environment variable
#       (which is used as a base for paths in "configs/paths/default.yaml")
#       (this way all filepaths are the same no matter where you run the code)
# - loading environment variables from ".env" in root dir
#
# you can remove it if you:
# 1. either install project as a package or move entry files to project root dir
# 2. set `root_dir` to "." in "configs/paths/default.yaml"

#This script appears to be the main entry point for training a model using Hydra for configuration. It also includes options for evaluation on a test dataset using the best weights obtained during training. Let's break down the script step by step:

#The script starts with importing necessary modules and functions from various files in the 'src' folder.

#It sets up the project root directory using the pyrootutils.setup_root function, which includes adding the project root directory to the PYTHONPATH and loading environment variables from ".env" in the root directory.

#The train function is defined, which is the main training process. It takes the configuration (cfg) as input and performs the training process according to the specified configuration.

#The training process includes instantiating the data module, model, callbacks, and loggers from the configuration (cfg). The hyperparameters are also logged using the log_hyperparameters function if loggers are available.

#The training process includes compiling the model if specified, starting the training using trainer.fit, and optionally evaluating the model on a test dataset using trainer.test. The best checkpoint path is obtained using the checkpoint_callback for testing.

#The evaluation results for both training and testing are merged into a metric_dict.

#The main function is defined, which serves as the entry point for the script. It uses Hydra to load the configuration (cfg) from the "train.yaml" file located in the "configs" folder.

#The utils.extras function is called to apply extra utilities to the configuration, such as enforcing tags, printing the configuration tree, disabling Python warnings, etc.

#The train function is called with the loaded configuration to perform the training process.

#The script retrieves the value of the optimized metric from the metric_dict using the specified metric name provided in the configuration.

#If this script is executed directly, the main function is called, and the training process is initiated based on the specified configuration. The script returns the value of the optimized metric.

#Overall, this script provides a flexible and configurable way to perform model training and evaluation using Hydra for configuration management and includes various utility functions to enhance the training process.
